      I don’t really know what to do with this website.
      Please excuse my web design incompetence.

    <h1>My Programming Language: Prose</h1>
    <p>
      Prose is a programming language I’m working on implemented in Python.
      It is a dialect of Lisp made by someone who hasn’t written any.
    </p>
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>
      The fundamental data structure of Prose is the list.
      A list is written like this:
    </p>
    <code>(a b c)</code>.
    <p>
      Code is also in lists – instead of <code>1+2</code>, you write <code>(+ 1 2)</code>.
      Fizzbuzz from 0 to 100 is written like this:
    </p>
    <code>
      (map (lambda (x) (if (= (% x 15) 0) `fizzbuzz'
                        (if (= (% x 5) 0) `buzz'
                         (if (= (% x 3) 0) `fizz')
                        )
                       )
           )
          (range 0 10 2)
      )
    </code>
    <h2>Current State of Things</h2>
    <p>
      Much basic functionality has been implemented.
      However, the parser is not complete, which means that instead of the above, to write fizzbuzz one currently has to write:
    </p>
    <code>
      code = [
        "map",
        [
            "lambda",
            ["x"],
            [
                "if",
                [
                    "=",
                    [
                        "%",
                        "x",
                        "15"
                    ],
                    "0"
                ],
                "`fizzbuzz'",
                [
                    "if",
                    [
                        "=",
                        [
                            "%",
                            "x",
                            "5"
                        ],
                        "0"
                    ],
                    "`buzz'",
                    [
                        "if",
                        [
                            "=",
                            [
                                "%",
                                "x",
                                "3"
                            ],
                            "0"
                        ],
                        "`fizz'",
                        "x"
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ],
        "range",
        "0",
        "101",
        "1"
      ]
    </code>
    <p>
      I intend to upload the source to github shortly.
